        <p>HomeAdvisor. Angi. Thumbtack. Porch. These companies promise contractors an easy stream of leads without the complexity of marketing. For many contractors, especially those starting out, this promise is appealing.</p>

        <p>But the contractor forums and review sites tell a different story: complaints about lead quality, shared leads, difficulty canceling, and questionable billing practices. What's the reality?</p>

        <p>This is an honest examination of how these platforms work, who they benefit, and when they might (or might not) make sense for your business.</p>

        <h2>How Lead Gen Companies Actually Work</h2>

        <p>Understanding the business model explains most of the complaints.</p>

        <h3>The Model</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Company spends money on advertising to attract homeowners</li>
            <li>Homeowner fills out a form requesting quotes</li>
            <li>Platform sells that lead to 3-5 contractors simultaneously</li>
            <li>Contractors compete to respond fastest and win the job</li>
            <li>Platform charges each contractor for the lead, whether they win or not</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The platform makes money by selling the same lead multiple times. Their incentive is to generate as many leads as possible and sell each one to as many contractors as will pay.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>The platform's customer is actually the homeowner (they're free). Contractors are the product being sold — you pay for access to customers who are simultaneously being given to your competitors.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Honest Pros and Cons</h2>

        <div class="pros-cons">
            <div class="pros">
                <h4>What Works</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leads show up without marketing knowledge</li>
                    <li>No upfront setup required</li>
                    <li>Can start immediately</li>
                    <li>Some leads are legitimate opportunities</li>
                    <li>Works for some contractors in some markets</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="cons">
                <h4>What Doesn't</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shared leads mean competing on price</li>
                    <li>Lead quality varies widely</li>
                    <li>No brand building — you rent access</li>
                    <li>Costs can spiral unexpectedly</li>
                    <li>Difficult to cancel or pause</li>
                    <li>Close rates typically 10-20%</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The Math Most Contractors Don't Do</h2>

        <p>Let's examine realistic economics:</p>

        <p><strong>Typical lead gen platform scenario:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cost per lead: $30-$80 (varies by service)</li>
            <li>Leads received: 20/month</li>
            <li>Close rate: 15% (industry average for shared leads)</li>
            <li>Jobs won: 3</li>
            <li>Total spend: $600-$1,600</li>
            <li>Cost per acquired customer: $200-$533</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Typical Google LSA scenario:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cost per lead: $30-$60</li>
            <li>Leads received: 20/month</li>
            <li>Close rate: 30-40% (exclusive, high-intent)</li>
            <li>Jobs won: 6-8</li>
            <li>Total spend: $600-$1,200</li>
            <li>Cost per acquired customer: $75-$200</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The difference isn't the cost per lead — it's the close rate. Exclusive, high-intent leads from Google convert at 2-3x the rate of shared leads from platforms.</p>

        <h2>Why Some Contractors Still Use Them</h2>

        <p>If the economics are worse, why do contractors keep using these platforms?</p>

        <h3>1. Simplicity</h3>
        <p>Signing up takes 15 minutes. No website needed. No marketing knowledge required. For contractors who find marketing overwhelming, this simplicity has real value.</p>

        <h3>2. Cash Flow Timing</h3>
        <p>New contractors need leads immediately. These platforms deliver leads within days. Building your own marketing infrastructure takes months.</p>

        <h3>3. Unpredictability of Alternatives</h3>
        <p>While Google LSAs are generally better, they require setup, verification, and optimization. Some contractors prefer the known (even if worse) over the unknown.</p>

        <h3>4. It Actually Works for Some</h3>
        <p>Certain service categories and markets do well on these platforms. High-volume, lower-ticket services where speed matters more than relationships can make the economics work.</p>

        <h2>When Lead Gen Platforms Might Make Sense</h2>

        <p>To be fair, there are scenarios where these platforms aren't terrible:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brand new business</strong> with no online presence and need for immediate cash flow</li>
            <li><strong>Testing a new service area</strong> before investing in local marketing</li>
            <li><strong>Supplementing other lead sources</strong> during slow periods</li>
            <li><strong>Services where lowest price wins anyway</strong> (basic handyman work, simple repairs)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Even in these cases, they should be a bridge strategy, not a permanent solution.</p>

        <h2>When to Avoid Lead Gen Platforms</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Premium services</strong> — Customers buying on price won't pay for quality</li>
            <li><strong>Relationship-driven work</strong> — HVAC maintenance, remodeling, ongoing service</li>
            <li><strong>High-ticket projects</strong> — Customers getting 5 quotes will comparison shop</li>
            <li><strong>Established businesses</strong> — You can do better with your own marketing</li>
            <li><strong>Markets with strong LSA presence</strong> — Google's platform is usually better</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Common Complaints — Addressed Honestly</h2>

        <h3>"The leads are garbage"</h3>
        <p>Some leads are bad — tire kickers, wrong phone numbers, people who already hired someone. This is true of any lead source. The difference is that with shared leads, even good leads have lower close rates because you're competing.</p>

        <h3>"They keep charging for bad leads"</h3>
        <p>Platforms have credit policies, but they're not generous. You'll pay for some portion of bad leads. Factor this into your expected cost per acquired customer.</p>

        <h3>"I can't cancel"</h3>
        <p>Most platforms have cancellation policies that aren't obvious when signing up. Read the fine print. Some require notice periods or have minimum commitments.</p>

        <h3>"My costs keep going up"</h3>
        <p>Lead prices on these platforms tend to increase over time. What started as $20 leads becomes $50 leads. This is how the platforms grow revenue — they have shareholders to satisfy.</p>

        <h2>Better Alternatives</h2>

        <p>For most established contractors, these options produce better results:</p>

        <h3>1. Google Local Services Ads</h3>
        <p>Pay per lead, not per click. Leads are exclusive. The "Google Guaranteed" badge builds trust. This is Google's version of HomeAdvisor, but with exclusive leads.</p>

        <h3>2. Google Business Profile</h3>
        <p>Free. Appears in map results. Builds your brand over time. The leads you generate are yours — no platform taking a cut.</p>

        <h3>3. Google Ads</h3>
        <p>More complex but more control. You own the relationship from first click. No middleman.</p>

        <h3>4. Referral Systems</h3>
        <p>Formalize referral requests. Offer referral bonuses. The best leads come from existing customers.</p>

        <div class="cta-box">

        </div>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>Lead generation companies aren't scams — they provide a real service. But their business model creates inherent conflicts with contractors' interests.</p>

        <p>They work best as a short-term bridge while building better marketing infrastructure. They work worst as a permanent strategy that keeps you dependent on rented leads.</p>

        <p>The contractors who do best long-term invest in marketing they control — their own Google presence, their own website, their own reputation. These assets compound over time rather than disappearing when you stop paying.</p>

        <p>If you're currently using lead gen platforms, don't necessarily stop immediately. But start building alternatives. The goal is to make platforms optional, not essential.</p>
