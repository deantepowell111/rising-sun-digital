## Brand Voice & Symbolism

Based on the master brand prompt:

- **Rising Sun**: Energy, growth, new beginnings, illumination
- **Waves**: Flow, systems, organic growth, connection
- **Rays**: Expansion, reach, structure, precision
- **Colors**: Warm (energy, approachability) + Green (growth, trust, sustainability)
- **Style**: Afrofuturism + Sacred Geometry = Future-forward yet grounded

---

## Usage Guidelines

### ✅ Do:
- Use the full wordmark logo in the header (horizontal layout)
- Use the circular icon for small applications (favicons, app icons)
- Maintain clear space around the logo (minimum 20px padding)
- Use monochrome versions when color isn't possible
- Scale proportionally - never stretch or distort

### ❌ Don't:
- Don't recreate or modify the logo
- Don't use low-resolution versions
- Don't add effects (drop shadows, glows, gradients)
- Don't place on busy backgrounds without proper contrast
- Don't rotate or skew the logo

## Next Steps for Complete Logo System

To fully implement the brand system described in the master prompt:

1. **Create stacked version** for vertical/square layouts
2. **Design standalone icon** (simplified sun/wave symbol only)
3. **Create submark/badge** for secondary applications
4. **Export favicon set** in proper sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, etc.)
5. **Develop social media kit** with proper dimensions for each platform
6. **Create brand guidelines PDF** with spacing, color specs, and usage examples
